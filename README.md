# Hybrid-IoT-AI-Agriculture-Supply-Chain-Punjab
Prototype for M.Tech thesis on IoT-AI model for Punjab agriculture supply chain management.
# Data Folder

This folder includes all datasets used by the simulation and AI pipeline.

- `punjab_crop_data.csv` : Cleaned and preprocessed dataset for wheat and paddy in Punjab, required for AI yield prediction and IoT simulation experiments.
- Any additional datasets or input files should be placed here for standardized access by the codebase.

 # Code Folder

This folder contains all core Python scripts for the Punjab Hybrid IoT-AI Agriculture Supply Chain project.

- `simulate_iot.py` : Comprehensive simulation script for IoT sensor data, AI-based yield prediction, and AWS cloud upload.
- Additional scripts and utilities for data processing, modeling, and automation are also maintained here.
